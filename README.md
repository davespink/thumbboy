This is a continuation of my previous project that spiraled into fix after fix after fix rabbit hole. The AI wrote some fantastic coke, but I didn't fully understand the full picture. I'm starting from scratch, but my old projects has a lot of functions I can resuse.

I want to go step by step and build up the the project on a sound basis.

The eventual short term aim is to develop a bookmarklet that can snag images from any page. There is a draggable panel that gets the images and puts them in a gallery in the panel. Copy of the jason can be taken and pased elsewere to build a photo album in a webapp.

The major drawback has been the workflow and how that has confused me and the chatbot both. So first mission is a sound workflow. The app works really well, it's the deployment that is at issue.

Yes—and your observation is spot on: when CORS/CSP allow it, you can fetch and read a 200 with data; when they don’t, the request may be blocked or the response is “opaque.” Here’s the landscape and how to make it robust.

Why some sites block it

CORS: If the endpoint doesn’t send Access-Control-Allow-Origin for the page’s origin, the browser hides the response (opaque).
CSP (connect-src): The site may forbid connections to your endpoint entirely.
Mixed content: HTTPS page → HTTP endpoint is blocked.
Cookies/credentials: If needed, server must also send Access-Control-Allow-Credentials and a non-* ACAO.
Patterns that work

Direct fetch (best when allowed)
Keep it a “simple request” to avoid preflight (GET/POST + text/plain, no custom headers).
Add credentials only if required (and configure server CORS accordingly).
async function callEndpoint(url, { method='GET', body, withCreds=false, timeout=5000 } = {}) { const ac = new AbortController(); const t = setTimeout(() => ac.abort(), timeout); try { const res = await fetch(url, { method, body, mode: 'cors', credentials: withCreds ? 'include' : 'omit', headers: body ? { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' } : undefined, signal: ac.signal }); return { ok: res.ok, status: res.status, data: await res.text() }; } catch (e) { return { ok: false, status: 0, error: e.message }; } finally { clearTimeout(t); } }

Server CORS (typical)

Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://actual-page-origin.example
Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, POST, OPTIONS
Access-Control-Allow-Headers: content-type
If credentials: Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true (and ACAO must be specific, not *)
Write-only fallback (no response reading, high success)
navigator.sendBeacon(url, blob) — reliable “fire-and-forget,” but you can’t read the response.
Image ping — <img src="...">; onload/onerror fires, but no response body.
Cross-origin relay (read response even when CORS/CSP block you)
Use your domain as a relay in an iframe or popup, then postMessage the result back.
This bypasses the host page’s connect-src (the fetch happens inside your origin).
Minimal iframe relay pattern

In bookmarklet (page):
const RELAY_ORIGIN = 'https://your-domain.example'; let relayFrame; function ensureRelay() { return new Promise((resolve, reject) => { if (relayFrame && !relayFrame.closed) return resolve(relayFrame); const iframe = document.createElement('iframe'); iframe.style.display = 'none'; iframe.src = RELAY_ORIGIN + '/relay.html'; iframe.onload = () => resolve(iframe.contentWindow); iframe.onerror = reject; document.body.appendChild(iframe); relayFrame = iframe; }); }

async function relayFetch(url, options) { const frameWin = await ensureRelay(); return new Promise((resolve, reject) => { const id = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2); function onMsg(e) { if (e.origin !== RELAY_ORIGIN) return; const { reqId, ok, status, data, error } = e.data || {}; if (reqId !== id) return; window.removeEventListener('message', onMsg); ok ? resolve({ ok, status, data }) : reject(new Error(error || 'relay failed')); } window.addEventListener('message', onMsg); frameWin.postMessage({ reqId: id, type: 'fetch', url, options }, RELAY_ORIGIN); }); }

In relay.html (served from your domain, no restrictive CSP):
When to choose which

Need response body and site permits: use direct fetch with proper CORS.
Need response body but site blocks CORS/CSP: use iframe/popup relay.
Don’t need response body (just “send it”): use sendBeacon or image ping.
Since you already have a server (and even a proxy), adding the iframe relay endpoint on your domain gives you a consistent way to fetch and return data even when the host page blocks direct requests.

## Trust & Verification

Bookmarklets are powerful and run with the same privileges as the page you click them on. Most users won’t read minified code, so here is a lightweight way to give users a basic integrity check of what they’re installing/use.

What we publish
- A reproducible bookmarklet payload generated by `deploy.html`.
- A SHA-256 hash of the exact minified payload (not including the `javascript:` prefix).

How to verify
1) Open `deploy.html` and click “Generate Code”.
2) Copy the “SHA-256 (of minified payload)” value shown.
3) Open `verify.html`, paste either the full bookmarklet (`javascript:...`) or the minified payload, and paste the expected SHA-256.
4) Click Verify. If it says “Match”, the code you have is byte-for-byte identical to the published build.

Limitations
- This only proves integrity against a published build, not that the code is safe.
- If the generation process or inputs change, so will the hash. We recommend tagging releases and publishing the corresponding hash in release notes.
- A compromised website could still allow data exfiltration if its CSP/Permissions-Policy are permissive.

Roadmap (optional)
- Consider offering a userscript/extension variant with explicit permissions.
- Publish release hashes and changelogs so users can compare updates.
