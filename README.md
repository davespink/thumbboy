This is a continuation of my previous project that spiraled into fix after fix after fix rabbit hole. The AI wrote some fantastic coke, but I didn't fully understand the full picture. I'm starting from scratch, but my old projects has a lot of functions I can resuse.

I want to go step by step and build up the the project on a sound basis.

The eventual short term aim is to develop a bookmarklet that can snag images from any page. There is a draggable panel that gets the images and puts them in a gallery in the panel. Copy of the jason can be taken and pased elsewere to build a photo album in a webapp.

The major drawback has been the workflow and how that has confused me and the chatbot both. So first mission is a sound workflow. The app works really well, it's the deployment that is at issue.
